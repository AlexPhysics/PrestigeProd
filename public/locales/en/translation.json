        "a1": "We're a full-service creative duo specializing in visuals that elevate corporate, branding, and real estate projects. Think cinematic brand films, heartfelt client testimonials, sharp professional headshots, and stunning architectural photography. What really sets us apart is our knack for creating a complete visual story capturing both video and photos in one smooth, efficient shoot to keep your brand looking consistent and polished.",
        "q2": "How do you figure out pricing for a project?",
        "a2": "Since every project is as unique as a fingerprint, we whip up a custom quote just for you after we chat. Our pricing considers things like how much planning goes into it, how many days we'll be filming, the size of our crew, what fancy equipment we'll need, and all the post-production bells and whistles (like cool motion graphics or subtitles in different languages). We'll give you a detailed, crystal-clear proposal, so there are no surprises. Let's chat no strings attached for a quote tailored to your exact goals!",
        "q3": "What's your creative process like, and what about revisions?",
        "a3": "Our process is all about working together and keeping communication flowing. It typically goes like this: 1) We chat and strategize, 2) We plan everything down to the last detail, 3) Lights, camera, action! (filming day), and 4) We work our post-production magic. You'll get a draft to review, and our packages usually include two rounds of revisions to make sure the final result is exactly what you pictured.",
        "q4": "Do you only work in Zurich, or can you travel?",
        "a4": "Absolutely, we're ready to roll wherever you are! While our home base is in Zurich, we happily serve clients all over Switzerland and across Europe. To keep everything super clear, any transportation and travel costs for our team and gear are always listed separately in our proposals, no matter where your project takes us.",
        "q5": "What makes your boutique studio different from a big agency?",
        "a5": "As a focused two-person team, your project isn't just another number it's our top priority. You'll work directly with us, the creatives, from start to finish, so your vision never gets lost in translation. We blend Swiss precision with captivating storytelling, using top-notch cinema-grade equipment to deliver stunning quality without the hefty overhead or impersonal vibe you might get from a larger agency."
